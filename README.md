# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify sonar signals as **Rock** or **Mine**.  
Sonar signals reflected from objects underwater have different patterns, and this project uses machine learning to predict whether the object is a harmless **rock** or a dangerous **mine**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Sonar dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It contains 60 features based on sonar signal readings.

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing  
3. Splitting dataset into train and test sets  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)  
5. Model evaluation  
6. Building a prediction system  

## ✅ Results
- Achieved accuracy of around **76%** on the test dataset.  
- Successfully built a system that can predict whether an object is a rock or a mine.  

## 🔗 How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
3. Run the cells step by step
